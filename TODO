1. Check serialization of long: -6478876429381754229
2. Check encoding binary encoding of: ["ecg",-6478876429381754229,Pid,"example_core",29633]
3. Change internal representatino of eterm, so that the refcount is moved from blob_t to
   eterm itself, so the layout of eterm would be the following:
     a. change eterm_type's storage:
            enum eterm_type : char;
     b. change eterm:
             struct eterm {
                 eterm_type       m_type;
                 atomic<int16_t>  m_rc;
                 union vartype {} m_data;
             }
